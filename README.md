# Search_List_Test

This is a sample project created to search a list of items using item names.

Tutorials followed : 
                    <ul>
                    <li> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QDTiOUOfKQ </li>
                    <li> https://larntech.net/android-listview-with-searchview-and-onitemclicklistener/ </li>
                    </ul>
                    
Modifications done: <br />In the original code, when searching for an item which is not found in the list, user was redirected to a search engine. 
Modified so that all items in the list are displayed in such situations.
